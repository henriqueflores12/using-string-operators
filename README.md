this example will display personalized welcome message on the page
the first line creates a variable called greeting which stores the message for the user here the greeting
is the word howdy.

the second line creates a varible that stores the name of the user. the variable is called name ,and the user in this casde is molly.

the personal wellcome message is created by concatenating (or joining ) theses two variable adding an exclamation mark and storing them in a new variable called wellcomeMessage.

look back at the greeting variable on the first line and note how there is ('space') after the word howdy. if the space was omitted ,the value of welcomeMessage would be "howdMolly!"
